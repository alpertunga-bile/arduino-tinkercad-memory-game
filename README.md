# arduino-tinkercad-memory-game
Memory game for arduino in tinkercad

How game works:
Game selects leds and show you with light and sound outputs. You have to push the correct light buttons to level up. If you fail, game resets itself and begin from level 1. If you succeed, you go to upper level and each level, light numbers increase and time between lights decrease. If you pass level 10, you win the game and game resets itself.
